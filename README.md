### Tank wars clone for final RsSchool task
#### INSTRUCTIONS
**The game is adapted only for desktops!**\
Registration allows you to save the game settings (from the main menu or from the game menu), returning them after login.

#### HOW TO PLAY
You can use your keyboard or game console buttons to control the tank and menu:

**↑ | UP** - increase shot power or select previous menu item\
**↓ | DOWN** - reduce shot power or select next menu item\
**← | LEFT** - increase tank canon angle or switch to prevoius menu option\
**→ | RIGHT** - reduce tank canon angle or switch to next menu option\
**SPACE | FIRE** - fire the projectile of press menu button\
**PAUSE(kbrd) | Pause/Start** - pause/resume game, start game with current settings or close ingame menu\
**ESCAPE | Settings** - open/close settings menu

+ In "game mode", you **can't** press pause or open the menu while the projectile is in flight or an explosion occurs to prevent cheating with the timer time.
+ In "game mode", during the explosion animation, you **can** adjust the angle and force of the shot.

#### If you miss or time runs out, the turn goes to the next player.

If you hit the enemy - after the animation of the explosion is completed, another shot can be fired. But the time is not reset - try to shoot as many opponents as possible during the round!

The last player left on the field wins. Good luck!
